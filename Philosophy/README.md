# Core Philosophy

**Are you a user or an owner?**

The main philosophy behind all of my products remains "True Ownership". If you're using what I develop, is it you who owns it or me?  
It's a bad idea to have your apps own you.

Some important questions to explore:
* If you want to learn more about how something works, is it possible for you to get to the bottom of it or will be met with a dead end after researching it a while?
* Can you verify the code in a timely manner or is there just too much of it that you'll have to take it on blind faith?
* Is it easy to read or is it designed to avoid being deciphered and make it harder to learn, follow, adapt and build upon? How magical is it?
* Is it modular or a giant monolith where if you remove one tiny part of it, the entire system collapses?

## The Burden
There's always a burden associated with any piece of software we integrate into our production chain. Ignoring that burden can easily lead to failure, sooner or later.

It consists of the ability to:
* Maintain
* Adapt
* Reuse
* Fix
* Succeed (Pass on)

Any magical monolithic giant software is never for the benefit of humanity, these are the apps that need PR firms, patches, forced updates etc. They're never designed to be owned and maintained by their new "users".
