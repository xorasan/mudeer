# Mudeer (arabic for manager)
Create tiny full-stacked PWAs (progressive web apps)  

Mudeer is a javascript framework that runs both on the server and the browser.  

## Features
* **independent** of other projects unless explicitly specified
* built with **care** in mind for all creation including humans and animals
* use the same basic shortcuts, **intuitive** to remember
* always extremely **small** in size, saves you data, space and time
* built-in full **black theme** to keep your eyes safe with automatic detection
* customizable **navigation** that works with keypad, touch, mouse, pen & keyboard
* **installable apps** on almost all platforms with modern browsers
* **modular**: only the features you need are included in the published app
* the same **unified** interface across all screen sizes that adapts to available space

## Goals
* **keep it simple**: why use database management systems like (mariadb, mongodb, ...),
  when a text file (.md, .txt) can do the job [Discussion](Philosophy/Databases.md)
* less noise, less clutter, more automation, more **peace** of mind

## Guidelines
Projects built on mudeer are encouraged to follow these guidelines  

* never send unwanted notifications to users
* actually use the apps you make yourself to know what users experience
* ...easy on your device's battery life
* ...never transmit user's private data
* should run in the background only when absolutely needed

## Tested Platforms

* KaiOS phones and other small screen devices with 12 button keypads
* Android/iOS phones with touchscreens of all kinds and sizes
